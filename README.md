# Dining-Philosophers-Problem
This project is about multithreaded programming in C++ and using locks for process synchronization. There are two solutions for the Dining Philosophers problem discussed in my Operating Systems Concepts class using locksâ€”one based on coarse-grained synchronization and one based on fine-grained synchronization.
